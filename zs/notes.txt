visual inspection of train data: 30000rows X 190cols

removed zero var cols, set na values to 1e-6, downsampled training
	sens ~ 0.6, ppv ~ 0.1

removing columns with more than 20% NAs
	ppv dropped from 0.10 to 0.08

changed downsampling to upsampling
	sampling method has no effect

applying rfimpute
	oob error after imputing: 38.18%
	oob error without imputing: >40% 

things to try out:
some vars exist with 2 unique values:
    apply(training, 2, sd, na.rm = TRUE) == 0, factorize these vars
    
treebag works
adaboosts works
